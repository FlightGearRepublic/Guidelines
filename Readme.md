# Code Guidelines
## Identation and Space vs Tab
### Don't save tabs in files
* Do not save tabs in files, using the tab key is useful for identing your code, but the tab lengh varies with font and text editor.
* All modern text editors allow you to save tabs as spaces.
* So instead save tabs as 4 spaces.

### Identantion size
* We use 4 spaces per tab/identation,

## Code Styling
* Open brackets on the function/method line.
```
function() {
    code {
      conditions
    } edoc
}
```
So close brackets and curly brackets on the same collumns the were opened.

## Comments
### COMMENT YOUR CODE!
* Always use plenty of comments in your code.
* Comment what a block of code is doing and maybe even what a line of code is doing!
* Not everyone will know what your code is about, and it's likely that people not profficient in programming will be reading the code trying to learn a programming language, so commenting a whole function might not be enough, explain what and how something is getting done in the code.
